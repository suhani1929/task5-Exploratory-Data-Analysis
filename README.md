# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Objective

To explore the Titanic dataset and identify factors that influenced passenger survival using data cleaning, visualization, and statistical techniques.


## 🧾 What I Did

Handled missing values (Age, Embarked, Cabin)

Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis

Used visualizations (bar plots, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps, pairplots)

Summarized survival patterns across gender, class, age, and fare


## 🗂️ Dataset Info

📦 Name: Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

📁 Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Rows: 891

Columns: 12

Main Features:
Survived, Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked

Missing Values:

Age: Filled with median

Embarked: Filled with mode

Cabin: Dropped due to sparsity


## 🔍 Key Insights

Gender: Females had much higher survival rates

Class: 1st class passengers survived more

Fare: Higher fare → higher chance of survival

Age: Younger passengers, especially children, had better odds


## 🧠 Conclusion

Survival was significantly influenced by gender, class, and fare, revealing socio-economic patterns in the tragedy. These features can be vital for building predictive models.
